Python Trials and Tests - python_data_persistance_tutorial.pdf

- launch the code with arguments
    eg:  python .\testPy.py CSV

- few topics were not tested as a code >> as therortical understanding is purely enough.
    1. object serialisation : serves the purpose of converting an object's state into a 
                              format that can be stored or transmitted, and then later 
                              recreated.
    2. Pickle module
    3. Marshal module
    4. shelve module
    5. dbm package :  provides an interface to DBM-style databases, which are simple 
                      on-disk key-value stores. Its primary purpose is to offer persistent 
                      storage for data, allowing key-value pairs to be saved to disk and 
                      retrieved later, even after the program has terminated.
